# Trigger-Timer
Sound, light or manual activated flash delay to capture high speed photography. Also operates solenoids for water drop collisions.

coming soon.

An easy DIY project to build a top quality, but cheap trigger timer for your camera.
Freeze motion, like bursting ballons (filled with water or powder) fruit being shot (air-pistol) or water drop collissions to capture that lovely crown effect.

The timer can be triggered by an external sensor, sound or light, or a push-button. After a user set delay, the flash wil fire. 
As a flash has a very short duration, any motion will be frozen. The delay can be adjusted to exactly the right moment to capture the photo.

Solenoid valves van be fired. this will allow the amazing water drop & collision photos.
Setting multiple drop sizes and time between drops, one can catch collisionas as the first drop splashes up as the next falling drop collides with it.

Building will follow the same formatas the other projects (so take a look at my github) using an ESP32 development board and pre-made modules. This elimates the need to make pcbs or use breadboard.
